# UHI & UHI Network

UHI is **envisioned as an open protocol for various digital health services.** UHI Network will be an open network of End User Applications (EUAs) and participating Health Service Provider (HSP) applications. 

- UHI will **enable a wide variety of digital health services** between patients and health service providers (HSPs) including, but not limited to:

	- Booking OPD appointments at hospitals / clinics
	- Booking Tele-Consultation
	- Discovering availability of critical care beds
	- Discovery of lab and diagnostic services
	- Booking of home visits for lab sample collections
	- Booking an ambulance
	- Discovery of nearby pharmacies

**End user application (EUA)** is any application chosen by the service consumer (frequently referred to as user) to access Health services. EUAs can be of diverse forms like mobile apps, interactive voice response systems (IVRS), virtual assistants in English and local languages, etc. 

Health service providers may be individual doctors, hospitals, labs, pharmacies, companies that aggregate health services, etc. They provide digital health services using Health Service Provider Applications (HSPA) that support UHI. 

**UHI ensures that a digital health service can be delivered between any EUA with any HSP in this ecosystem.**
