## RSA Encryption
RSA(Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is an Asymmetric encryption technique that uses two different keys as public and private keys to perform the encryption and decryption. With RSA, you can encrypt sensitive information with a public key and a matching private key is used to decrypt the encrypted message.
