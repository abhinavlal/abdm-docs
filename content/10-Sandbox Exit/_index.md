## Sandbox exit process

**Step 1:** Functional & non-functional Testing of the application by an internal NHA team Draft test cases for functional evaluation can be found in the below link 
- [Test cases for M1](../11-test-cases/milestone-1/)
- [Test cases for M2](../11-test-cases/milestone-2/)
- [Test cases for M3](../11-test-cases/milestone-3/)

*Note :* From 5th August 2022 onwards, the functional & non-functional testing of the application will be conducted by NHA empaneled agencies which are as below:

1. M/s FIME India Pvt. Ltd.

2. M/s Suma Soft Pvt. Ltd.

The integrators (new and the existing ones) who are not able to get themselves certified by the cut off date will be required to get the testing conducted by any of these agencies only.

**Step 2:** Security testing of the web/mobile application from any STQC or CERT-IN empaneled agency. Applicants are requested to engage with relevant agencies and submit the “Safe-to-Host” certificate to NHA

STQC may also reach out to perform validation testing on a few sample applications.

**Step 3:** A final round of approval for application go-live will be sought from the internal team at NHA. Applicants will be required to share the following before the committee:
- Functional testing report for integrations completed
- Safe-to-Host certificate for the application

**Step 4:** Once approved, access will be shared for integration in the production environment.

Kindly ensure the partnering HIP is registered on [Health Facility Registry {{% icon icon="share-square" %}}](https://facility.ndhm.gov.in/) in order to interface with the ABDM infrastructure.

Detailed walkthrough on facility registration steps can be found in [video link {{% icon icon="share-square" %}}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqe-dlQcLIo). Once registered, the HIP will be required to update production access bridge ID in their Health Facility Registry profile – please find all steps demonstrated in [document {{% icon icon="download" %}}](./Steps_for_linkage_of_a_Verified_Health_Facility.pdf "download")
