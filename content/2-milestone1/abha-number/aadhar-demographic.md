## Functional Overview

The aim of this is to ensure whichever Healthcare Facility the user (patient) goes to, they are identified uniquely; that is for unique identification we need ABHA number.

When a person is trying to create ABHA number for the user (may be when there's no connectivity, i.e. "offline"), this method is used.
Supposed to be used for/by health workers (like Asha, A&M) in their public applications.

- Health worker is expected to capture the Aadhaar number, name, year of birth and gender of the patient (user) as in Aadhaar card.
- These details can be physically captured on paper or in mobile application which works in offline mode as well. Consent of the user must always be obtained (in paper or offline apps) in the recommended language.
- When connectivity is available, the application calls the ABHA demographic API with the same (Aadhaar number, name, year of birth and gender) information.
- The ABHA system checks with UIDAI if the information provided is correct.
- The ABHA system also checks if an ABHA number has already been created in the past.
- Then the system returns the ABHA number (already created or generates new).

When calling this API, care must be taken to ensure:
1. The correct state and district of the beneficiary are passed.
2. The mobile number that is passed is assumed to be verified by the government application and is not re-verified by ABHA.
3. Any public health program specific ID (eg: PMJAY id, CoWin id, RCH Id) can be shared as part of the benefit id in the API.
4. The client id used to call this API must have the integrated_program roll configured in production.

## Test Cases

**Note:** ABHA creation through Demographic Auth/ Offline mode (avaibale only for trusted entities. All Government entities are  elligible)
