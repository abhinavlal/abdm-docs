# Creation of ABHA Number

**ABHA number** is a 14 digit number that is unique (only one per person) issued only after a strong KYC. ABHA is a core building block of the ABDM ecosystem that was essentially designed to ensure that people can have a unique ID (identifier) for healthcare.

ABHA numbers are extremely important for helping those who use feature phones or do not use a phone to manage their personal health records. ABHA numbers are issued in assisted mode extensively by all Government health programs.
