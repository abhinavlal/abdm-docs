# Display Health Records

- For a given granted consent, the idea is to **decrypt the received data and then display the health records** in longitudinal format (that is, chronological order).

- If the consent is **revoked or expired** then:

	- HIU should not display the health records of the user 

	- HIU has to mandatorily delete any copy of health records that they hold


- If thereâ€™s a way to summarise the results, analyse the reports so that it makes it easy for the Doctors / Consultants to make patient analysis easier.
