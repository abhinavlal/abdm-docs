# Scan and Share

## Functionality Overview

Every PHR Application needs to provide the ability for their users to scan a health facility QR code and share their ABHA address, profile information with health facilities.

1. The App must be able to integrate with the phone camera and read the content of QR Code
2. The App must also support an [**intent**](/abdm-docs/5-building-a-phr-app/support-deep-links/index.html) where it must go directly to the sharing page, if the QR code was scanned with a different camera.
3. The content of the QR code is a URL (sample for reference: [https://phrsbx.abdm.gov.in/share-profile?hip-id=IN3410000260&counter-id=12345](https://phrsbx.abdm.gov.in/share-profile?hip-id=IN3410000260&counter-id=12345)) that contains 2 parameters:
   1. The HIP ID
   2. Facility defined context (for example: counter code)
4. Once the QR code has been scanned, the PHR App must present to the user all the information that will be shared and obtain a consent with the ABDM specified language. The consent says _“You agree to share your ABHA Address and profile information with this facility for the purpose of registration and the facility can link any health records generated by….” (take reference from the screenshot attached)_
5. Once the user consents, the PHR App can call the HIE-CM API to share the details with the health facility.
6. The Health facility is currently expected to respond within 30 seconds.
7. The facility can optionally share a token number.
8. The PHR app must display a token number and not allow the user to generate a second token number for the next 30 minutes.

## Test Cases

**Scan and Share** - Scan the QR code to share information.

Scan QR Code at the ABDM compliant health facility to get token number for better queue management and completing faster patient registration.

There are 2 use-cases here:
