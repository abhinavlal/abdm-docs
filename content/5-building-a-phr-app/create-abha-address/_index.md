# Creation of ABHA Address

## Understanding ABHA Address

**What is ABHA Address?**

ABHA Address is an easy to remember username that enables a user to access their health records digitally and share their records with various healthcare providers. An ABHA address may look like ‘name@abdm’. It is required to sign up on ABHA Application

Every 14-digit ABHA number is automatically issued a default ABHA address on the ABDM HIE-CM, which looks like 14-digit@sbx or 14-digit@abdm.

**Create ABHA Address**

The user can also create a user defined name on the HIE-CM that can be linked to this ABHA number. for example: ramesh123@abdm, so that's easy to remember for them.

It is also possible to create an ABHA address that is not linked to an ABHA number on the HIE-CM using mobile, name, age & gender.
