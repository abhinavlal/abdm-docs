# For Command Line

The core logic for [**Fidelius CLI 59**](https://github.com/mgrmtech/fidelius-cli) has been excerpted from (and improved upon) this [SpringBoot project 14](https://github.com/sukreet/fidelius) (with the same name, which has been used in some form, in the webinar demos).

A few of the core improvements include:

- A CLI implementation, which can be easily integrated into any tech stack without much overhead
- An expansive, well thought-out set of APIs
- The encryption/decryption commands also accept public keys in X509 format
The latest Fidelius CLI release (v1.2.0 as of this writing) can be [downloaded from here](https://github.com/mgrmtech/fidelius-cli/releases)

- You can also find example integrations with NodeJS, Python, and PHP; in the [examples](https://github.com/mgrmtech/fidelius-cli/tree/main/examples) 59 folder inside the [repo.](https://github.com/mgrmtech/fidelius-cli)

- We also have a short video demonstrating Fidelius CLIâ€™s usage in the context of a HIP.
