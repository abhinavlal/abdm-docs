## Discovery and Linking of patient records

- ABDM allows a user to find their health records from any health facility they have visited via the discovery process. 
- Users can use an PHR app to select the health facility they visited and initiate a "Discovery" request 
- The HIE-CM forwards the discovery request to the the HRP linked to the health facility
- All HRPs / HIPs must correctly implement the discovery API
- The HRP is expected to return all the care contexts for the user if records are found 
- The user can then link them to their ABHA address. 

### Sample User Experience

{{< gallery dir="3-milestone2/link-care-context/user-experience" />}} {{< load-photoswipe >}}

### Implementing the discovery algorithm

1. When a discovery request is initiated by the user, the HIP will receive a list of verified identifiers along with name and demographic information. Verified information includes the ABHA address, the mobile number name, gender, year of birth. Unverified / user declared information can include a medical registration number issued by the health facility and shared by the user.

2. The HRP must search for records that match this patient by implementing the matching logic depicted in the flowchart below

id1 -->|Yes| id5((Return<br/>matching Records))
id1{Do any records match ABHA Address?} -->|No| id2{Doany records match Mobile number?}
id2 --> |No| id9{Do any records match <br/>Medical Record Registration number?}
id9 --> |Yes|id3
id9 --> |No|id4((No<br/>matching records<br/>found))
id2 -->|Yes| id3{Does the gender match?}
id3 --> |No| id4
id3 -->|Yes| id6{Is the age within +/- 5 years?}
id6 --> |No| id4
id6 --> |Yes| id7{Is the name phonetically similar?}
id7 --> |No| id4
id7 --> |Yes| id8((Return<br/>matching Records))

3. As response to the discovery request, the HRP/HIP must organize the patient data into [care contexts](/abdm-docs/3-milestone2/understand-care-context/) and respond with a list of care contexts found. Ensure no clinical information is shared in the response.

## API Information Request Response 

#### DISCOVERY

**1. Discover patient's accounts**

Request for patient care context discover, made by Gateway intended for a specific HIP.

**BASE URL:** Callback URL registered by HRP

{{< swaggermin src="/abdm-docs/Yaml/ndhm-hip.yml" api="POST /v0.5/care-contexts/discover$" >}}

**2. Response To Patient's Account Discovery Request**

**BASE URL:** https://dev.abdm.gov.in/gateway

{{< swaggermin src="/abdm-docs/Yaml/ndhm-hip.yml" api="POST /v0.5/care-contexts/on-discover$" >}}

# Linking of discovered care contexts

![Link Record Step 3](/abdm-docs/img/linkrecord-Step3.png)

## Verify the patient and link the carecontext as requested by the patient

- This flow begins once a user initiates a link request after discovering care comtexts.  
- The User shares the reference number and care contexts to be linked via the PHR app
- On getting the link/init request 
 The HIP system sends an OTP to the patientâ€™s phone number. 
Note, the phone number for OTP communication from HIP may be the same as verified by the HIE-CM or maybe a different number that the patient has chosen as preferred mode of communication with HIP - meaning it's up to the HIP to choose the phone number it sends OTP to. 

- The patient, via patient app, submits the OTP received from the HIP system within the stipulated time. If the patient is successfully authenticated by the HIP, the linking is now complete.
