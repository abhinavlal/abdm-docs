## Get Milestone 2 Certified

**Functionalities of Milestone 2:** Building Health Information Provider (HIP) services to share digital records via any Personal Health Records (PHR) application.

The Milestone 2 can be explained with 2 scenarios:

**Scenario 1:**
- User has shared ABHA Address during Registration (1 of 3 ways from [verification of ABHA address](/abdm-docs/2-milestone1/verify-abha-address/index.html))
- Expectation is HIP initiated linking (that whenever a new health record is created for this user, it is linked to a care context)

**Scenario 2:**
- User has not shared ABHA Address during Registration.
- Expectation is to send an SMS that a new health record is available with a deep link; and to support user initiated discovery & linking
