## Bahmni

Bahmni is an OpenMRS Distro. It is an open source EMR and a full Hospital Management System with Lab, Billing, Pharmacy, PACS and other integrated features. An instance of Bahmni has been setup to act as a Health Information Provider and Health Information User in the ABDM Sandbox. This can be very useful for testing the following use cases during ABDM integration. 

- To see examples of how Milestone 1 is integrated in a HMIS / LMIS
- To test Milestone 3 if you are integrating the same in a HMIS or PHR app
- To test most of the PHR app related testcases that require a HIP / HIU

In October of 2017 Thoughtworks transferred ownership of Bahmni to the Bahmni Coalition under the Fiscal Sponsorship of the non-profit OpenMRS, Inc.
