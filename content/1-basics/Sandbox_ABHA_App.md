While building and testing your health repository in integration with the sandbox’s network components, you’ll need to test patient flows as well. For example:

- Signup of patient with Consent Manager (CM)
- Linking patient’s CM account with HIP’s patient reference and health care contexts
- Granting or revoking consents
