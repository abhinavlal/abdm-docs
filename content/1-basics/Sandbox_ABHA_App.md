The ABDM Sandbox features a reference PHR application which can be used to simulate the consumer side experience. If the software you are integrating is a HMIS / LMIS, we highly recommend that you 

- Download and install the Sandbox ABHA app on an android phone
- Create an ABHA address that you will use during integration. This looks like *yourid@sbx*
