## Download and Import environments variables
The Environment variables allow developers to store and reuse parameter values in API requests and scripts. If you need to update a variable value, you can do it in one place and the value will be automatically changed throughout your request collections. The environment variables in Postman can be used in the URLs, in the POST parameters, in the JavaScript code, etc. To specify the variable, use the brackets as a variable name placeholder({{ }}. For example, {{access_token}}).

Download ABDM Environment variables [here](../ABDM.postman_environment.json) (ABDM.postman_environment.json)

**Step-1:** Select the **Environments** in the left and then click on Import button in the Postman application.
