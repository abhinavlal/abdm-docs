Read this section to understand how various building blocks of ABDM works and where your application fits in the ecosystem
{{% /notice %}}

ABDM uses a federated architecture to help users collect their health records across various healthcare providers, view their records from any PHR application and share their records with any requestor with their consent 

The image below shows the various entities/roles involved in the PHR framework

![ABDM HIP HIU Architecture](../phr-architeture.pptx.jpg)

## What is a Health Information Provider (HIP)?
Any entity that agrees to share digital health records with their users using the ABDM APIs  is called an HIP (Health Information Provider). HIPs can be hospitals, labs, health care centers, government health programs, teleconsultation players, clinics or pharmacies - basically any entity which creates medical data pertaining to a patient. 

HIPs are required to maintain a digital copy of both the inpatient and outpatient records for each person in their care. In order to become an HIP, health facilities must enrol in the ABDM [health facility registry](https://facility.abdm.gov.in) and adhere to the [HIP HIU Guidelines](https://old.abdm.gov.in/assets/uploads/HIP_HIU_Policy.pdf)

## What is a Health Repository Provider (HRP)?
 Health repository providers are software service providers who offer ABDM compliant software to health facilities like hospitals, diagnostic centers etc. An instance of an ABDM certified software is a HRP. The HRP enables healthcare providers to become HIPs or HIUs and meet their obligations of sharing and securely maintaining health records of patients digitally. HRPs offer long term storage of health records on behalf of a HIP. For example, a hosted lab information management system provider (LIMS) may update their software to become a ABDM compatible Health Repository Provider. Any lab using this hosted LIMS software can rapidly become a HIP by adopting the software. The organizations that make ABDM certified software are referred to as Digital Solution Companies (DSCs) by NHA.

## What is an HIU?
An HIU (Health Information User) is an entity that wants access to digital health information about a user. An HIU can be a hospital, clinic, healthcare technology company, organizations working on health analytics, insurers, medical 
researchers, government entities etc.  HIUs will be able to request for health records of a user, and upon obtaining the user's digital consent, access a copy of the patients records and use them for the time period consented by the user.  

## What is a HIE-CM?
HIE-CM stands for Healthcare Information Exchange and Consent Manager. This is the key ABDM building block that enables creating ABHA addresses,  managing consents related to user's personal health data and supports exchange of interoperable health data across HIPs and HIUs.

The ABDM architecture is designed to support multiple HIE-CMs to operate in the network. Each HIE-CM is referred to by a domain. NHA operates 2 HIE-CMs currently. A Sandbox HIE-CM with the domain @sbx and a production HIE-CM with the domain @abdm.  

## What is an ABHA address?

In order to manage their personal health records, users must first create an account on a HIE-CM -- called their Ayushman Bharath Health Account (ABHA) address. This looks like sandeep321@abdm. The @abdm tells us which HIE-CM is responsibile for this address. 

{{% notice%}}
The term ABHA address is also reffered to as PHR address across the documentation
{{% /notice%}}


Hospitals & Labs are expected to link records with their patients ABHA Address. Creating an ABHA Address is super simple â€“ You can start with just Name, Year of birth, Gender along with a Mobile number. ABHA address can be linked to a strongly validated & unique ABHA Number

ABDM is designed to work for people with smartphones, features phones and even those without phones. Users with smartphones can be encourgaed to get their ABHA address via a PHR app. They can create a easy to remember ABHA address that is alphanumeric like sandeep321@abdm. Users with only feature phones or without phones will require assitance in creating an ABHA address. It is recommended that they create an ABHA number (preferably with Aadhaar). Every ABHA number also automatically acts as a ABHA address on the HIE-CM and looks like <14digitabha>@abdm 


Key benefits of creating an ABHA Address are:
- Easy access to health information in a paperless manner
- Voluntary opt-in and opt-out at anytime
- Enables authentication for consent driven access to health data along with capabilities  to manage and revoke consent
- Inclusive access to people with smartphones, feature phones, and even no phones using assisted methods
![Get ABHA Address](../Abha-address.png)

Users can create an ABHA address by downloading a PHR mobile application or on a portal provided by the HIE-CM. Use [phr.abdm.gov.in](https://phr.abdm.gov.in) to create a new ABHA address 

{{% notice%}}
Users can create an ABHA addresses in one of two ways:
1.  Using self declared information - This requires Name, Year of Birth gender along with a mobile number or email 
2.  Using an ABHA Number - This requires users to first create an ABHA number with strong KYC 

{{% /notice %}}
Users can start with a self declared ABHA address and later link it to an ABHA number 

{{% icon icon="user-check" %}} *Note* : While users are allowed to create more than one ABHA address, ABDM encourages every user to have only ONE ABHA address. The process of obtaining an ABHA address is designed to ensure that users don't accidentally create multiple addresses

{{% icon icon="user-check" %}} *Try it out* - Create an ABHA address that you can use on the ABDM sandbox at [phrsbx.abdm.gov.in](https://phrsbx.abdm.gov.in). This will create an ABHA address on the @sbx HIE-CM hosted within the sandbox 

## What is an ABHA Number?
ABHA number is a *14 digit number* that is unique (only one per person) issued only after a strong KYC. Every ABHA number is automatically available as an ABHA address like <14digitabhano>@abdm. ABHA is a core building block of the ABDM ecosystem and integrates with several other systems to provide online KYC including Aadhaar, Driving licence and PAN 

You can obtain an ABHA number by signing up at [https://abha.abdm.gov.in](https://abha.abdm.gov.in)

ABHA numbers are extremely important for helping those who use feature phones or do not use a phone to manage their personal health records. ABHA numbers are issued in assisted mode extensively by all Government health programs. Government programs are encouraged to link any health records they create to <14digitabhano>@abdm.

## What is a PHR application? 
Personal Health Record Applications are software service providers who offer front ends to individuals and enable them to create a ABHA address, discover and link health records from various HIPs, allow users to view their records, offer long term storage of records, upload users health records and share records on the ABDM network. PHR Apps work closely with the HIE-CM and provide a front end for HIE-CM actions like viewing and granting consents. 
(Note: All PHR Apps are also Health Lockers in earlier version of the HIP/HIU guidelines)

## How does a HIE-CM create a longitudinal Health record 
ABDM is implemented as a Federated Architecture, where data is kept by the entity that generates the health data (HRP). When a new record is generated by health facility it adds a link called a *care context* to the user's PHR address. A PHR address holds the set of links to the health data across multiple facilities (HRPs). The HIE-CM is designed to be data blind, ie it does not know any details of the health records that are linked with the PHR address and the architecture ensures that any exchange of health data does not pass through the HIE-CM. 

The architecture is also fully aligned with the upcoming Data Protection Bill. The intent is to enable any health facility using a ABDM compliant software to be automatically compliant to the Data protection bill. The HIE-CM as keeps track of all consents provided by the user. Consents are structured as digital consent artifacts that is based on the MietY consent framework 

![How HIE-CM builds a PHR ](../hie_cm_linking.png)

{{% notice%}}
The Architecture ensures that there is 
- No central data repository
- Your PHR Address only holds links
- Each Health record is held by Health Facility that generated the record
- Health facilities that become HIPs collect & save your PHR address during registration
- HIP / HRPs notify or link new health records with your PHR address 
- HIP / HRPs share a copy of the linked record after verifying user consent
- Patient can get a copy of the records and view it using a PHR app
- PHR apps act as repositories that hold a copy of the the health records long term for the user
- Patients can also upload records by scanning them or from their wearables via PHR apps 
- Only HIPs that are part of the Health Facility Registry can link health records with a PHR address

actor user
Note over hiu : Hospital would like to access medical history with consent
Note over hrp : Health Repository Providers holding user data
hiu->>hiecm: Sends consent request to ABHA address(user)
hiecm->>user: Presents consent request to user
user->>hiecm: Users grants consent
hiecm->>hiu: Signed consent from user
hiu->>hiecm: Request data with signed  consent
hiecm->>hrp:  Request HRP to Share data with HIU after verifying consent
hrp->>hiu: Encrypted health data in FHIR format
{{< /mermaid >}}

- When any HIU wants to access records linked with a PHR address, it initiates a consent request with the HIE-CM
- The consent request consists of the purpose for which health records are being sought, why type of records are being sought, from what time period and how long will the HIU like to retain these records
- HIE-CM forwards the request to the user who can view the request on their PHR app and decide what he actually wants to share when he grants the consent
- User's can also decide to revoke the consent anytime after it is granted
- If the user grants the consent, the HIE-CM shares a signed consent artificat with the the requesting HIU
- The HIU can now request for data for a PHR address along with the signed consent artificat
- The HIE-CM forwards the request to all HRPs that are holding the linked data 
- The HRPs verify the consent and push the data to the HIU
- Data has to be in the specified FHIR format to achieve interoperability 
- Data is encrypted using a method that ensures only the requesting HIU can decrypt the data 

 ## The ABDM Gateway 
Gateway is the hub that mediates and connects HIE-CMs, Health Repository Providers and HIUs in the network. Its primary job is to allow for discovery, routing in the network. The gateway does the following:

- Connects and validates the HIE-CMs and health repositories (servicing HIUs and HIPs) to the network.
- Enables routing of information.
- Authenticates connected systems within the PHR network (provides a signed authentication token for further communication). 
The entire PHR framework including the gateway communicates via asynchronous APIs over HTTPs channel.

The following figure provides a view of how the Gateway fits in with other components
