# HCX Integrators

Please visit [**HCX Documentation**](https://sbxhcx.abdm.gov.in/) for detailed Health Claims Exchange Specifications.

To support the vision of Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY), **NHA has created a standardized health claim platform based on the Health Claim Exchange Specification (HCX)** to enable automation of the health claim-related information exchange between payers, providers, beneficiaries, and other relevant entities. 

The specification provides an interoperable, machine-readable, auditable, verifiable, and open standard-based structure protocol for communication between the entities.

The **FHIR Implementation Guide** for ABDM has been updated to support HCX specifications. The ***preview of the IG*** is hosted at -[https://www.nrces.in/preview/ndhm/fhir/r4/hcx-profile.html](https://www.nrces.in/preview/ndhm/fhir/r4/hcx-profile.html)

For HCX, a new record named ‘InsuranceRecord’ and related profiles and value sets has been introduced under the section HCX profiles.

Please test these changes and do share your inputs/feedback/concerns to the below email ids before August 12, 2022:

1. nrc-help@cdac.in
2. integration.support@nha.gov.in

Based on the inputs/comments the updated IG will be finally published for production use.
